Simon-Says
==========

Simon Says tests your memory skills by using color "patterns". I randomly create the sequence as the player progresses. When the player makes a mistake, I create a new sequence.

GLUT setup
==========

Include your GLUT files in your project properties.
C/C++ -> General -> Additional Include Directories: add the folder where the GLUT include file is located.
Linkers -> General -> Additional Lirbary Directories: add the folder where the GLUT library file is located.
Linkers -> Input -> add the following:
opengl32.lib
